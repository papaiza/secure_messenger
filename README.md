# secure_messenger
Python application for secure messaging between members of a hospital. 

To run the system, while in the main directory run:

### exe/messenger.exe -b [path_to_acceptance_test]

For example:
### exe/messenger.exe -b acceptance/student/at2.txt

This will generate a file called at2.expected.txt which will show the output of the user commands and actions.

For a full explanation on the system, check the messenger.pdf file in the docs folder.
